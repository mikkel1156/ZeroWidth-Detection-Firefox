# Zero-Width Detection Firefox
This addon for firefox is used for finding zero-width characters on pages, it shows how many characters, how many bytes they take up, and the ability to copy them into the clipboard as well.

On the preferences page for the plugin you can whitelist sites that are not run any operations on, and an option to choose what you want to replace with, the default being ðŸ•µ (if you want to strip characters, just set it to nothing).

*Will be published to Mozilla when it works and looks like I want it to.*
